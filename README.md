## Briefing

**Dublin Inn Real Estate** is a specialist rental company across Ireland. Based in Dublin, the company has a simple website that receives around 2,000 simultaneous hits per day.

In just over 1 year of the website, the marketing team of **Dublin Inn Real Estate** noticed that the volume of access to the website was falling, contributing with a significant portion of the company's revenue.

Based on this information, the team of analysts decided to investigate the reason for the decrease in access and found that the site had become obsolete and the system no longer supported the number of daily accesses, which required a redesign of the entire web application. Therefore, the marketing team launched a proposal to innovate the company's visual identity.

## Challenge

Concerned about this metric falling, the CEO of **Dublin Inn Real Estate** hired me to develop a new web application for the company.

At the end of the work, it is expected that a new application will be delivered, with a new identity, new functionalities, reliable and scalable, which supports more simultaneous accesses than the old website.

The company's business team gave me a report on the features that the CEO wants:

> 1. A website whose purpose of the company is immediately understood by the user.
> 2. Have a clear information on what the site is about and what it provides
> 3. Have an easy navigation that is consistent throughout the website
> 4. Consistent layout without any confusing elements
> 5. Accessibility considerations are taken throughout the site
> 6. A form where the user can filter the search by properties, passing information such as location, property type and price range (*This functionality does not exist in the current application*).
> 7. A functionality where the user can schedule a visit to one or more properties and a dashboard where he can view, edit and/or delete a visit (*This functionality does not exist in the current application*).
